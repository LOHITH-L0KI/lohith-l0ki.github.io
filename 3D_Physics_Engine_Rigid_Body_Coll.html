						<h1 class="major">3D Physics Engine: <i>Rigid Bodies</i></h1>
						<p>
							Developed a physics engine to support rigid-body collision of 3D objects and integrated it into the existing in-house game engine, Azul. Created a demo showcasing free-falling chairs. Implemented various optimization techniques to enhance system performance.

							<h2 class = "work">My Work</h2>
							<p>Architected and Implemented collision system in 3 stages.</p>
							<div class = "subWork">
								<h3>Collision Detection: </h3>
								<p>
									This stage is processed in two phases-broad phase and narrow phase. In the first phase <i>(Broad)</i>, collision checks are performed between Bounding Volumes of game objects. I implemented techniques like Grid Spatial Partitioning and hash mapping which improved collision check efficiency by 20%. In the next phase <i>(Narrow)</i>, colliding objects are traversed through their BVH to precisely find the point of contact.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class = "subWork">
								<h3>Contact Generation: </h3>
								<p>
									In this stage, I implemented logic to generate collision data like interpenetration depth, contact normal, and coefficient of restitution based on the type and state of motion of the objects.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class = "subWork">
								<h3>Contact Resolving: </h3>
								<p>
									Here, contacts are resolved by performing math operations and physics equations to get the final state of objects.
								</p>
							</div>

							<p>
								Further, I multithreaded the system, improving the performance by 12% and providing sufficient computational time for rendering and executing complex shaders.
