						<h1 class="major">Game Engine: <i>Azul</i></h1>
						<p>
							In my master's program, I designed and developed a 3D game engine called Azul using C++. This engine utilizes DirectX 11 APIs for graphics rendering. Additionally, I created a file converter that allows for the generation of custom files compatible with the engine from various file formats.

								<h3>Memory Management: </h3>
								<p>
									I designed and implemented a custom memory system for high-speed memory allocation and tracking. I implemented a technique called object pooling, where memory is pre-allocated for each object type at program startup. This approach improves runtime performance by approximately 5%.

								<h3>Custom Converter: </h3>
								<p>
									Developed a custom file converter utilizing tiny-GLTF and Google Protocol Buffers. This converter facilitates the conversion of various file formats, including glTF, glb, and PNG, into a single, engine-specific format (.azul). This streamlines the asset pipeline by consolidating model data and textures into a single, efficient file for use within the Azul game engine.

								<h3>File System: </h3>
								<p>
									Implemented a File system that can load and unload files using Windows File Manager.

								<h3>Enigne: </h3>
								<p>
									Designed and architected a 3D game engine, including a custom math library. Implemented optimization techniques like RVO, SIMD, and Proxy collision, resulting in a 14% performance improvement.<br>
									Developed shaders for vertex, pixel, and geometry stages of the rendering pipeline. Additionally, implemented compute shaders, achieving a 20% performance boost in object animation. To facilitate efficient object traversal during updates and rendering, designed a Parent-Child-Sibling (PCS) tree structure.
